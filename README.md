## Building tool

Our project was developed in Visual Studio Code, using React and PHP.
There are several reasons to consider using React for the frontend of a gambling app with a PHP backend:
1.	Interactive User Interface: React allows you to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, enhancing the user experience of your gambling app. With React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM, you can create responsive and real-time updates to provide a seamless and engaging gambling environment.
2.	Efficient Rendering: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates and renders only the necessary components, resulting in optimized performance. This is particularly important for a gambling app where real-time updates and smooth animations are crucial for user engagement.
3.	The combination of React and PHP also facilitates efficient communication between the frontend and backend. React can make HTTP requests to PHP API endpoints, enabling seamless data exchange and real-time updates. This ensures a smooth and responsive gambling experience for users.
4.	By utilizing React for the frontend and PHP for the backend, you can create a feature-rich gambling app that delivers an engaging user interface, robust functionality, secure data handling, and efficient communication between client and server.

## Bug reporting

We have encountered the following bugs:
1.	The returned id from the spinner endpoint is not good for the first request, because the record is not updated and therefore the last played id will be shown. To see the fixing, click here.


## Automation Testing

For testing we have used Symphony. Symfony is a PHP framework that provides a solid foundation for building web applications. While Symfony itself does not provide specific tools or features for automation testing, you can leverage various testing libraries and frameworks within the Symfony ecosystem to implement automated testing for your Symfony-based application.
